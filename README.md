Map My Tweets
=============

This application allows a Twitter user to sign in and have any geotagged tweets (currently within their most recent 200) to be plotted on a Google Map.

After cloning in the usual way, this can be installed with the usual `npm` and `bower` commands.

    npm install
    bower install
    
You will also need credentials for the Twitter API. These can be generated by creating a new app on [Twitter's Application Management website](https://apps.twitter.com/). Once these credentials have been acquired, they should be saved in `server/credentials/credentials.json` (creating the `credentials` directory if it doesn't already exist). A template for `credentials.json` is given below.

    {
        "consumer_key": "[your Twitter consumer key]",
        "consumer_secret": "[your Twitter consumer secret]",
        "access_token_key": "[your Twitter access token key]",
        "access_token_secret": "[your Twitter access token secret]",
        "callback_url": "http://localhost:6002/auth/twitter/callback",
    }
    
Once the Twitter credentials have been supplied, this application can be run by issuing the following command:

    node app
    
When the app is running, go to [`http://localhost:6002`](http://localhost:6002) and sign in to Twitter by clicking the button shown. You should then be shown your geotagged tweets (from the most recent 200) on a Google Map.

Please note that no Twitter data (including tweets) is stored by this application. All of the data is simply pulled directly from the Twitter API and, if a geotagged tweet is found, shown on a Google Map. Nothing else is done with this data.
